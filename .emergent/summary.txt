The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer across several distinct, user-driven tasks. The work began with fulfilling marketing asset requests for the Seaweed Swimmer game, which involved creating screenshots with text overlays and producing a promotional video. This phase required debugging frontend services and troubleshooting image/video generation tools like ImageMagick and ffmpeg.

A significant portion of the work involved creating and deploying a developer website on GitHub Pages to host an  file for AdMob verification. This task escalated into a complex, multi-step debugging session, resolving issues with GitHub Pages configuration, repository structure, DNS, and build processes (specifically, disabling Jekyll).

The engineer then assisted with AdMob integration, verifying ad unit IDs and diagnosing why ads weren't serving (correctly identifying the need for mediation groups or a waiting period for activation).

Finally, the focus shifted to rebranding the website into a developer portfolio for Zeroncool and fulfilling a new request to create a self-contained, zipped HTML5 playable ad version of the game for Google Ads. The engineer demonstrated strong iterative development, robust troubleshooting skills across multiple domains (frontend, deployment, third-party services), and clear communication with the user.

<product_requirements>
The project encompasses two main products and several supporting tasks.

1.  **Seaweed Swimmer (Mobile Game):** An existing Flappy Bird-style mobile game built with React and Capacitor. The primary goals were ongoing maintenance, Google Play compliance (Android 15, app icons), and monetization via AdMob. This required creating marketing assets (screenshots, videos) and ensuring the AdMob integration was correctly configured with proper ad unit IDs and an  file.

2.  **Zeroncool Developer Website:** A static portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages. Initially created to host the  file for Seaweed Swimmer, it was later rebranded as a professional portfolio for the developer Zeroncool. Its requirements included displaying a logo, an About Me section, a Featured Games section showcasing Seaweed Swimmer, a contact email, a privacy policy, and a Google Search Console verification file.

3.  **HTML5 Playable Ad:** A self-contained, single-file HTML5 version of the Seaweed Swimmer game, packaged in a ZIP file for use in Google Ads campaigns.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend/Game:** React, HTML Canvas API, Capacitor
- **Monetization:** AdMob (Banner & Interstitial Ads)

<code_architecture>
The codebase consists of the original game's frontend and a new directory for the developer website files.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main landing page for the developer portfolio website. It serves as the public face for the developer, Zeroncool.
    -   **Changes:** Underwent a complete transformation from a game-specific page to a developer portfolio. It was updated to include the Zeroncool logo, a new About Me statement, a featured game card for Seaweed Swimmer (with its own screenshots and a live Google Play link), and a contact section.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Critical file required by AdMob to verify authorized sellers of ad inventory, preventing fraud.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch with the user's publisher ID based on a provided screenshot. Its successful deployment was a primary driver for creating the website.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages all AdMob logic, including initializing ads, showing banners, and triggering interstitials.
    -   **Changes:** The  flag was toggled between  and  for debugging purposes. The production ad unit IDs within this file were verified against the user's AdMob account to ensure they matched.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the native app configuration for Capacitor, including the crucial AdMob .
    -   **Changes:** The  was verified against the user's AdMob screenshot to confirm it was correct.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A critical fix for the GitHub Pages deployment. This empty file, placed at the repository root, prevents GitHub from running the Jekyll static site generator, which was causing build failures.
    -   **Changes:** Created to solve a major deployment blocker.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A self-contained, single-file version of the game, designed to be used as a playable ad.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch, embedding the game's core logic, styles, and assets directly into the HTML to ensure it runs without external dependencies.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Monitor AdMob console to confirm that production ads become active and start serving in the live application.
- The original request to create a 30-second video of actual, engaging gameplay was substituted with a slideshow video. Creating a true gameplay video remains an unresolved task.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to create a standalone HTML5 version of the Seaweed Swimmer game suitable for a Google Ads playable ad campaign. The previous engineer successfully completed this by:

1.  **Creating a self-contained game file:** A new file, , was created. This single file encapsulates all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ported from the original React component) to make the game run independently in a browser.

2.  **Packaging the ad:** The directory containing the HTML file and a README was compressed into a zip archive: . This zip file is the final deliverable for upload to an ad platform.

3.  **Providing Documentation:** A usage guide, , was created to explain the purpose and use of the generated zip file.

The work on this specific request was concluded, and the AI was summarizing its completion right as the trajectory ended. All necessary files have been created and are located in the  directory.

I will present the created HTML5 ad package () and its usage guide to the user, confirming that the task is complete and asking for the next set of instructions.
