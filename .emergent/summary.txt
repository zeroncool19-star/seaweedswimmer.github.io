The AI engineer has demonstrated extensive capabilities in both maintaining and evolving an existing game, Seaweed Swimmer, and initiating a new, more complex sequel, Seaweed Swimmer 2. Key work on the original game involved numerous UI/UX enhancements, audio fixes, addictiveness features, and crucial Google Play compliance updates (e.g., app icon, intro screen, Android 15 compatibility, fish graphics/animation, removing features). Simultaneously, the engineer architected and partially implemented Seaweed Swimmer 2 with Babylon.js for 3D graphics and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend for online leaderboards, adapting to user feedback by simplifying its scope to 2.5D. The work shows strong iterative development, debugging of deployment and rendering issues, and detailed versioning and documentation for each release. The engineer is adept at handling diverse technical challenges from game logic to platform-specific deployments.

**Original Seaweed Swimmer (v0 to v51):** The user’s primary goal was to launch a Flappy Bird-style mobile game on Google Play. This entailed:
-   **Core Gameplay:** Tap-to-swim, time-based scoring, local high scores, increasing difficulty, AdMob integration.
-   **UI/UX:** Tap to Start, responsive design, accessible menus, comprehensive high score achievements, improved layout.
-   **Audio/Visuals:** Intro screen, theme music, SFX/haptics, resolving audio issues (crackling, delay, music over ads), dynamic fish graphics with animated tail, professional intro screen image.
-   **Addictiveness:** Score milestones, near-miss feedback, daily challenges.
-   **Sharing:** Share visual scorecard (later removed).
-   **Android Compliance:** Resolved build errors, managed Capacitor plugins, incremented , handled keystore, removed resizability/orientation restrictions, migrated deprecated APIs for Android 15, implemented custom app icon.
-   **Performance:** Frame-rate independent speed (), faster fish drop.
-   **Marketing Assets:** Create a 30-second gameplay demo video, eye-catching screenshots with text.

**Seaweed Swimmer 2 (In Development):** The user requested a new, completely separate application featuring:
-   **Online High-Scoring System:** Global leaderboard with unique usernames.
-   **Retro 3D Graphics:** PS1 era style using Babylon.js, CRT screen effects, retaining existing color scheme with shade variations.
-   **Architecture:** Completely new app, backend for leaderboard.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React & Hooks:** Frontend game logic, UI, state management.
-   **HTML Canvas API:** 2D rendering (original game).
-   **Babylon.js:** 3D rendering (Seaweed Swimmer 2).
-   **Capacitor:** Hybrid app framework for Android.
-   **FastAPI:** Backend API for online leaderboards (SS2).
-   **MongoDB:** Database for SS2 (implicit via ).
-   **Web Audio API:** In-game audio/SFX.
-   **Local Storage:** Client-side data persistence.

The application suite currently consists of two distinct projects: the original  (Seaweed Swimmer v43-v51) and the newly developed .

**Overall Directory Structure:**


**Detailed Directory Structure & File Importance:**

-   ** (Original Seaweed Swimmer):**
    -   ****: Capacitor's native Android project.
        -   ****: Crucial for Android  (incremented up to 51), dependencies, and build configurations.
        -   ****: Edited to remove  and add  for large screen support.
        -   ****: Contains various  directories for app icons and  for adaptive icons. Updated to include custom app icon across multiple resolutions.
    -   ****: Main HTML file. Edited to add meta tags (, ) for Android 15 edge-to-edge display.
    -   ****: **CORE GAME LOGIC.** Manages game state, rendering, UI, physics, and interactions.
        -   **Changes:** Heavily modified throughout the trajectory for: daily challenge migration fix (v43); enhanced fish graphics (gradients, eye, fins, scales) (v45); dynamic tail fin animation on tap (v45); integration of professional intro screen image with animations (v46); fixing mobile intro screen timing (v47); removing Share Score button (v48); removing  plugin imports/usage (v49); adjusting  for faster fish drop (v51).
    -   ****: Manages AdMob integration.
    -   ****: Controls in-game music and sound effects.
    -   ****: Capacitor configuration. Edited to remove the  plugin for Android 15 compatibility (v49).
    -   ****: Frontend dependencies (React, Tailwind, Capacitor, etc.).

-   **:**
    -   ****: FastAPI backend for online leaderboard. Implemented , , ,  endpoints, using UUIDs for IDs.
    -   ****: Python dependencies for FastAPI backend.

-   **:**
    -   ****: Basic HTML shell for the React app.
    -   ****: Root React component.
    -   ****: Entry point for the React app.
    -   ****: Global CSS.
    -   ****: **CORE SS2 GAME LOGIC.** Handles Babylon.js 2.5D rendering, PS1 effects (initially via custom shaders, later removed for built-in), game state, and leaderboard integration.
        -   **Changes:** Created to render a Babylon.js 2.5D game. Initial issues with shader compilation were resolved by removing custom shader code. Fish and seaweed visibility (size, position, thickness) were adjusted to make gameplay elements clear. Integrates with the new  for leaderboard interactions.
    -   ****: Handles API calls to the SS2 FastAPI backend for leaderboard functionality. Initially had an issue with  pointing to production URL, fixed to use  for local development/testing.
    -   ****: Placeholder for AdMob, copied from original.
    -   ****: Game audio logic, copied from original (v43 adapted).
    -   ****: Capacitor configuration for SS2.
    -   ****: Frontend dependencies including , , .
    -   ****: Project specific README.
    -   ****: Testing documentation.
    -   ****: Comprehensive setup guide for the SS2 project.

<pending_tasks>
-   Recreate the 30-second gameplay demo video () to show actual, engaging gameplay instead of quickly ending in a game over.
-   Add eye-catching, simplistic text overlays to the captured game screenshots for Google Play Store listing.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of generating eye-catching screenshots of all aspects of the game with eye-catching simplistic text for each screenshot as requested by the user (Chat Message 555). The latest action was to initiate the screenshot capture process for various game states (intro, menu, gameplay, game over).

Specifically, the system successfully executed a command to capture screenshots (Chat Message 557) and confirmed that the screenshots were captured (). The next logical step, as indicated by the AI's internal thought process, is to copy the screenshots and add eye-catching text overlays to each one (Chat Message 560). This task directly follows the user's explicit request for marketing assets for the Google Play Store. This work is focused on the original  application, which is currently at version 51, incorporating all previous updates like improved fish graphics, animated tail, enhanced intro screen, and Google Play compliance fixes.
